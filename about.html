    <h1 class="notion-h1">We're building the world's first inside-out research platform.</h1>
    <p style="font-size:13px;color:#9ca3af;margin-bottom:32px;">Last updated February 2026 · <span style="color:#7c3aed;font-weight:500;">Early stage · Pilot phase</span></p>

    <div class="callout">
      <p>"The people who know your brand best are already on your payroll, in your loyalty app, or stocking your shelves. Insidr gives you a direct line to them — anonymously, ethically, and in hours."</p>
    </div>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2 class="notion-h2">What we're building</h2>

    <p class="notion-p">Insidr is a consumer insights platform that helps large brands run research through communities they already own — employees, loyalty members, retail partners, and brand ambassadors — rather than recruiting strangers from third-party panels.</p>

    <p class="notion-p">The platform does three things:</p>

    <ul class="notion-ul">
      <li>Builds anonymous consumer profiles for every participant in a brand's community, enriching them with every interaction</li>
      <li>Lets brands run any research method (micro-missions, AI-moderated interviews, co-creation sessions, focus groups) against those communities in hours rather than weeks</li>
      <li>Surfaces AI-powered insights that connect findings across studies, so understanding compounds over time instead of living in a forgotten deck</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="notion-p">We call the layer that stores all these profiles <strong>the Consumer Cloud</strong>. Think of it as a living, anonymous intelligence layer for a brand's most important people.</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2 class="notion-h2">The problem we're solving</h2>

    <p class="notion-p">The global market research industry spends somewhere between $40–80 billion a year helping brands understand consumers. Most of that money goes to agencies recruiting strangers — people with no relationship to the brand, no context about its products, and no reason to give considered, honest answers.</p>

    <p class="notion-p">Meanwhile, every brand already has people who know exactly what's working and what isn't:</p>

    <ul class="notion-ul">
      <li>The sales rep who hears competitor comparisons at point of sale every day</li>
      <li>The loyalty member who's been buying for 7 years and switched one category last quarter</li>
      <li>The retail partner who sees which SKUs get passed over on the shelf</li>
      <li>The brand ambassador who knows the objections customers raise in the wild</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="notion-p">Nobody is systematically asking these people. Insidr is building the infrastructure to change that — at scale, in real time, and with privacy built into the architecture from the ground up.</p>

    <h2 class="notion-h2">The founder</h2>

    <div style="display:flex;align-items:flex-start;gap:16px;margin-bottom:24px;">
      <div style="width:52px;height:52px;border-radius:50%;background:linear-gradient(135deg,#ede9fe,#c4b5fd);flex-shrink:0;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;font-size:20px;font-weight:700;color:#7c3aed;">D</div>

        <p style="font-size:15px;font-weight:600;color:#111827;margin-bottom:2px;">Dhaval Chokshi</p>
        <p style="font-size:13px;color:#9ca3af;margin-bottom:0;">Founder &amp; CEO · insidr.club</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="notion-p">Dhaval grew up in Gujarat, India, and moved to Mumbai at 18. Over the past seven years he has been a two-time founder, brand strategist, and consumer insights professional — working with brands including Reebok, H&M India, and Delhi Airport through internships at DDB Mudra, and most recently running global consumer insights at Opella, one of the world's largest consumer healthcare companies. He co-founded Vinci Stationery, growing it to a community of 10,000+ customers and collaborating with 1,500+ independent artists. He graduated from Narsee Monjee College, Mumbai (9.5/10 SGPI in Marketing) and is currently completing a Master in Management at ESSEC Business School in Paris, where he was selected for the ESSEC–Accenture Strategic Business Analytics Chair.</p>

    <p class="notion-p">He founded Insidr in 2024 after seeing — across agencies, startups, and global brands — how much valuable consumer knowledge sits untapped inside organisations: in sales teams, loyalty programmes, and partner networks. Traditional research, he found, rarely touched any of it.</p>

    <h2 class="notion-h2">Where we are</h2>

    <p class="notion-p">We are currently in <strong>private pilot</strong>, working with a small number of brand partners to validate the core product and refine the experience. We are not yet publicly available.</p>

    <p class="notion-p">If you're a brand that wants to be part of the pilot, we'd love to hear from you.</p>

    <h2 class="notion-h2">Our principles</h2>

    <h3 class="notion-h3">Privacy is architecture, not policy</h3>
    <p class="notion-p">Brands never learn who their consumers are as individuals. All identities are pseudonymised before they enter our research layer. The insight is always aggregate; the person is always protected. <a href="privacy.html" style="color:#7c3aed;text-decoration:none;">Read our privacy policy →</a></p>

    <h3 class="notion-h3">Value flows both ways</h3>
    <p class="notion-p">Communities participate because they get something back — rewards, influence, and a genuine voice in the brands they care about. Research that doesn't reward participants doesn't work long-term.</p>

    <h3 class="notion-h3">Speed and depth aren't a trade-off</h3>
    <p class="notion-p">Getting answers in 4 hours from people who deeply know your brand is better than waiting 6 weeks for results from strangers. We're building the infrastructure to make that the default.</p>

    <h3 class="notion-h3">Institutional knowledge should compound</h3>
    <p class="notion-p">Every study you run should make the next one smarter. Insights shouldn't expire when a PowerPoint is filed. Insidr is designed to be a persistent knowledge layer, not a series of one-off projects.</p>
